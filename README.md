## Description


# The project was to increase the webpages accessibility by adding and altering the semantic elements of the starter HTML code provided. This includes adding alt text to images. My motivation for the project was to understand how HTML can help with the accessibility of a site, to improve my understanding of semantic elements and to also understand how to update the CSS file when adding semantic elements to the HTML file. An example is when trying to condence the code, by grouping identical elements into a single class, I understood where to find these classes in the CSS file and update those accordingly. I had to also research and implement new semantic features such as <figure> and <article> which I have not come across yet. I also learnt more about classes and ID, and which to use when styling.

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

# The website uses alt text to be more accessible to end users. All links within the website have also been updated to navigate to the correct text when clicked on, for example, if you were to click on the 'seach engine optimization' tag at the top in the header, the website will naviagte you to the correct article explaining this in more depth. This was done by correctly updating all the ID's in the HTML file. The classes have also been updated to condence the code to make it more fluent.
